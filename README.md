## App File Structure

The code.isrealconsulting.com application is developed in PHP 
and is hosted on Google App Engine.  Development occurs in a
workspace on Codenvy.  Updates to the Main app (the actual website
that loads for the domain) is controlled by GIT.  Applets (the
code and pages that can be called by external sites and apps)
are in their own folders.

### Main App (code.isrealconsulting.com)

The Main app is displayed when you visit the App Engine URL
in a browser.
